# salary-prediction-ml-streamlit
End-to-end salary prediction project using Python and machine learning. Includes EDA, feature engineering, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models. Evaluated using R² and RMSE metrics and deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application.

# Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts employee salaries based on various input features using machine learning regression models. The workflow includes data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

##  Objectives
- Analyze factors influencing salary
- Build accurate regression models
- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics
- Deploy the best model as a web application

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Joblib
- Streamlit

##  Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Building:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor
5. Model Evaluation using R² Score and RMSE  
6. Pipeline creation and model saving using Joblib  
7. Deployment using Streamlit

##  Model Performance
- Evaluated models using R² and RMSE metrics
- Selected best-performing model for deployment

##  Deployment
The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input features and get real-time salary predictions.
